# Simple Boolean Functions Minimizer

Hey there! This program is a simple boolean functions minimizer developed just for fun during my studies in Computer Architectures. The algorithm used for the minimization is the [Quine-McCluskey Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine%E2%80%93McCluskey_algorithm).
